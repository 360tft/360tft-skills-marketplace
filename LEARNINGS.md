### Patterns
- Two distinct email drip sequences (creator vs consumer) convert better than one generic sequence — creators need validation that listing is worthwhile, consumers need tool discovery and usage tips
- Reviews with a structured rubric (accuracy, usefulness, response quality, value) give actionable feedback to creators and credible ratings to consumers — free-text reviews alone don't provide comparable signals
- Sponsored listings with Stripe subscriptions as the first monetisation layer for a free directory — creators list free, sponsors pay for visibility
- Notion as a hosted cheat sheet platform for lead magnets — cheaper than custom hosting, already has sharing/embedding, and Kevin has existing workspaces

### Gotchas
- RLS policies must be created with DROP IF EXISTS before CREATE to avoid 42710 errors — same pattern as every other product, still gets missed on new tables
- Try-tool rate limiting (2 tries per tool per user) is essential to prevent free abuse of API credits — without it, anonymous users can make unlimited calls to paid product APIs

### Decisions
- Branding aligned to "AI Football" with 360TFT attribution in footer — consistent with other products in the ecosystem
- Email capture wired up with separate creator and consumer drip sequences — two different audiences need different nurture paths
- Sponsored listings shipped with Stripe subscription billing — first revenue mechanism before per-use pricing
- Content tools (guides, tutorials, documentation) added as a tool category alongside MCPs and skills

## 2026-02-26

### Patterns
- MCP/skills marketplace positioning: "first football AI skills marketplace" targets a niche before the broader AI marketplace space gets crowded — being early in a specific vertical beats being late in a general one
- Free-to-list with per-use monetisation (users pay, not creators) removes the creator acquisition barrier — creators won't list on a marketplace that charges them when distribution is uncertain

### Decisions
- Free to list for creators, charge users for access — removes friction for getting tools listed while generating revenue from consumption
- PRD updated with full task list including migration to dedicated Hetzner server — scope is now clearly defined for build phase
- Marketplace will allow listing of MCPs, skills, and custom tools — not just one format, supporting the emerging ecosystem of AI tool types
