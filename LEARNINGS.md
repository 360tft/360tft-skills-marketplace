### Patterns
- MCP/skills marketplace positioning: "first football AI skills marketplace" targets a niche before the broader AI marketplace space gets crowded — being early in a specific vertical beats being late in a general one
- Free-to-list with per-use monetisation (users pay, not creators) removes the creator acquisition barrier — creators won't list on a marketplace that charges them when distribution is uncertain

### Decisions
- Free to list for creators, charge users for access — removes friction for getting tools listed while generating revenue from consumption
- PRD updated with full task list including migration to dedicated Hetzner server — scope is now clearly defined for build phase
- Marketplace will allow listing of MCPs, skills, and custom tools — not just one format, supporting the emerging ecosystem of AI tool types
